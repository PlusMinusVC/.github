# PlusMinus

Building thoughtful AI agents through design-led innovation and rigorous business model validation.

## Our Vision

PlusMinus is a venture studio that creates vertical AI agents validated through systematic business model testing and user-centered design. We believe that sustainable AI products emerge from the intersection of human needs, viable business models, and thoughtful design.

## Our Approach

At PlusMinus, we follow a structured validation process:
- Begin with Value Proposition Canvas mapping to align user pains, gains, and jobs-to-be-done
- Validate business models through systematic hypothesis testing and real-world experiments
- Apply design thinking methodologies to craft intuitive user experiences
- Iterate rapidly based on market feedback and business model validation
- Scale only after achieving product-market fit and business model validation

## Our Philosophy

We believe that successful AI products must satisfy three core criteria:
1. Solve real user needs identified through careful research and validation
2. Operate within a sustainable and scalable business model
3. Deliver value through thoughtful, human-centered design

Our process combines the rigor of business model validation with the empathy of design thinking. Every vertical AI agent we build is subjected to thorough testing of its value propositions and business assumptions before scaling.

## Validation Process

Our systematic approach includes:
- Value Proposition Canvas mapping for each vertical
- Business Model Canvas iteration and validation
- Continuous user research and feedback loops
- Rapid prototyping and hypothesis testing
- Revenue model experimentation and validation
- Market sizing and segmentation analysis

## Portfolio

Our AI agents are built for specific verticals, each validated through our rigorous business model and design process. We focus on markets where we've identified clear value propositions and sustainable business models.
